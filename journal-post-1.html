            <p>Six months isn't that short—it's actually quite long for a dancer. If you stop dancing for one day, it's okay. Two days? Fine. Maybe even a week. But once you stop for longer than that, your body starts to feel weird, and your mindset changes compared to when you're dancing regularly.</p>

            <p>When I got injured in August, I almost quit dancing. I felt like I'd never dance again because my knees and back hurt so much. For the past half-year, at least one part of my body always felt off. I couldn't dance, so I stayed away from the local dance scene, my dancing friends, and even my coach. Sometimes, I didn't even have the courage to watch their Instagram stories because I knew they'd be posting dance videos—and I couldn't join.</p>

            <p>Another concern was judgment. I know I can start again whenever I want since I'm not a professional dancer—I don't rely on this for a living. But I was afraid people would think, <em>"She used to dance so well—what happened to her now? She's just average, or even below."</em> Dancing was my thing—my specialty. It made me feel like I was better than others, and I didn't want to lose that. Maybe it's a narcissistic thing, I don't know.</p>

            <p>It took me a long time to finally go back to the dance studio. Just stepping inside again took me a month. Last week, I took my first class since November. I wouldn't say it felt <em>good</em>—just normal. And today, I practiced the piece I learned last week. I felt okay—not like before, but at least I wasn't being hard on myself anymore.</p>

            <p>The most important thing today was freestyling to that song. It's by Catherine, a choreographer from Australia—she's amazing, with that groovy, water-like movement. She used it in a solo freestyle video (in black and white), and I wanted to try something similar. I wanted to see what would come out of it—if something surprising would happen.</p>

            <p>And it did. I've never felt so emotional while dancing before. Usually, I'm just thinking about the moves, the beats, whether I'm doing it right. But this time, I didn't know how to start. I stood there for a while, unsure. Then I told myself, <em>"Just move one arm, then the other, then your leg—don't overthink it."</em></p>

            <p>I went to the ground and stayed there for a long time. Usually floorwork is not my thing, but this time, I felt so connected to the earth—so close to nature, almost spiritual. Then I stood up, leaned against the wall, and got really emotional. I think I even cried a little.</p>

            <p>When I watched the video back, some movements still felt awkward, but I'm trying to accept that part of myself. At this stage in my life, I don't plan to become a professional dancer or rely on this for money. It's just a hobby—something personal, meaningful, and fun. Of course, I'll keep taking classes, especially once I feel better. But I also want to spend more time exploring movement with myself and friends.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that's it for today.</p>
